The **Shrestha Lab** is a computational cancer genomics and data science research group at the **[Center for Prostate Disease Research (CPDR)](https://sites.google.com/usuhs.edu/cpdr)**. Our research interests fall under the broad categories of cancer genomics, computational biology, systems biology, and machine learning. 

Our research will focus on the following three major avenues:
- **Develop** cutting-edge computational genomics and machine learning methods to unravel the complexities of cancer
- **Mine**, Integrate & Analyze complex multi-modal biological datasets to understand context-specific genome regulation in cancer
- **Translate** genomic insights to meaningful clinical applications for precision oncology

We focus on elucidating the drivers of cancer progression and therapeutic resistance, with the goal of advancing personalized medicine and improving clinical outcomes for prostate cancer patients by understanding the complex interplay of the genome, transcriptome, proteome, and epigenome.

In the Shrestha lab, we aim to understand a fundamental question: 
> **Why certain individuals with prostate cancer develop aggressive, treatment-refractory disease and acquire resistance to targeted therapies, while others exhibit a favorable response to conventional therapeutic modalities?** 

The answer to this question lies in understanding the heterogeneous biology of the tumor and its environment, which largely dictates the clinical course and outcomes. We address this critical, unmet challenge using an integrated approach that leverages genomics and epigenomics, coupled with advanced techniques in computational biology and machine learning.
