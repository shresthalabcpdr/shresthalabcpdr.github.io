We are thrilled to announce the opening of the Shrestha Lab, a dedicated Computational Cancer Genomics and Data Science research group, has officially opened its doors, located at the Center for Prostate Disease Research (CPDR) under the Henry M Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine (HJF) in Bethesda, Maryland. The lab is a part of Murtha Cancer Center Research Program (MCCRP) and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC). The Shrestha lab is primarily affiliated with the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), Dept. of Surgery, with a secondary affiliation at the Genitourinary Malignancies Branch (GMB), National Cancer Institute (NCI).

Led by Dr. Raunak Shrestha, the lab will focus on harnessing large-scale genomic and clinical data to improve the understanding of prostate cancer. Through innovative computational approaches, the team aims to translate complex data into actionable insights that can drive personalized therapies and improve patient outcomes.
