I’m a bioinformatics researcher in computational oncology. I work on single-cell and spatial multi-omics (scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, and spatial ATAC), with a focus on building reproducible pipelines and translating complex genomic data into clear biological insights. Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, playing billiard and cycling to reset.
